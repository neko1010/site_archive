## USGS Site Visit Archive Tool 

Designed to automate an otherwise tedious archival process of measurement and inspection files following
visits to the field for both surface water and ground water field visits. Select files to be archived 
and add them to the list using the **Add Files** button. These files will find their way to the appropriate
location after the **Archive** button is clicked. All files must belong to the same site visit, and the 
site visit XML file must be present to determine how files are archived. Currently only supports one site 
visit at a time. Ancillary data sets that include comprehensive lists of all surface water and groundwater 
sites by state should be updated as necessary.
