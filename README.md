## USGS Site Visit Archive Tool 

Designed to automate an otherwise tedious archival process of measurement and inspection files following
visits to the field for both surface water and ground water field visits. Select files to be archived 
and add them to the list using the **Add Files** button. These files will find their way to the appropriate
location after the **Process Files** button is clicked.
